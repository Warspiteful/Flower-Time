sunBreakdown_5870c366	s	It shouldn't have hurt me as much as it did...	game/script.rpy	1569	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_6c5ddac1	s	But I was devestated. And it made me realize... like...	game/script.rpy	1570	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_3902e54c	s	...When sunflowers can’t find the sun, they look to each other.	game/script.rpy	1571	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_62c810e4	s	But I don't. I feel like I look to other people first. I want them to like me...	game/script.rpy	1572	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_236bbc71	s	I want them to like me more than I even want sunshine.	game/script.rpy	1573	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_77ee7366	s	Huh?	game/script.rpy	1581	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_e1554201_1	s	...	game/script.rpy	1598	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_a1d69e8d		She starts to cry.	game/script.rpy	1599	"[what]"
sunBreakdown_3dafae8d	s	I'm sorry... I just...	game/script.rpy	1601	s "[what]"
sunBreakdown_31619596	s	I don't like musicals.	game/script.rpy	1602	s "[what]"

sunBreakdown_fc700971	s	That's okay. And it feels really good to finally say.	game/script.rpy	1617	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_5f96cdf8	s	...Thank you.	game/script.rpy	1631	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_62f81795	s	For letting me tell you this. And the whole date. I really did have a good time.	game/script.rpy	1633	s "[what]"

dateEndingFinaleSun_1f9f8e84	s	Hehe, I am! I can HATE it!!!	game/script.rpy	1642	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_a2106a00		She seems very excited by the prospect of hate. She's practically vibrating.	game/script.rpy	1643	"[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_b08c1752	s	I should probably get to bed. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?	game/script.rpy	1644	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_b177084e	s	Night, Chrys.	game/script.rpy	1648	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_c2ccbb8a		That night, as you go to flowerbed, you realize there's something you want to ask Sunny in the morning.	game/script.rpy	1650	"[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_edc00147		The next day...	game/script.rpy	1651	"[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_a1f6f7e4		You head to Sunflower's spot. She's soaking in the sun, but you notice she looks a little wilted.	game/script.rpy	1653	"[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_cdf93508	s	Good morning!	game/script.rpy	1655	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_f9a7b39a	s	Yup! I know I'm a little wilted. I cried a bunch last night. It was...	game/script.rpy	1659	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_9086e606	s	AMAZING! CRYING WHEN YOU'RE SAD FEELS GREAT!	game/script.rpy	1661	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_2a85b8fc	s	Sure! What's up?	game/script.rpy	1669	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_0ab16323	s	!!!	game/script.rpy	1677	s "[what]"
dateEndingFinaleSun_0c8160c0	s	You...	game/script.rpy	1678	s "[what]"

dateEndingFinaleSun_ccbb36d4	s	Chrys, that's so sweet.	game/script.rpy	1681	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_1a3f60df	s	...Can I tell you something, again?	game/script.rpy	1688	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_7df6956d	s	I'm scared.	game/script.rpy	1689	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_76a7ef55	s	I'm scared that if I date somebody right now, I'll try to find my happiness through them.	game/script.rpy	1690	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_3c7a3a22	s	I'm scared I'm not emotionally ready for a relationship.	game/script.rpy	1691	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_cf171cfc	s	But you...	game/script.rpy	1693	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_6fc6ad6e	s	You make me want to try anyway. I genuinely believe that you'll support me.	game/script.rpy	1694	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_d2ff408c	s	So if you're okay with that, with me still figuring it out...	game/script.rpy	1695	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_6787b3c5	s	Then I'd love to be your Valentine.	game/script.rpy	1696	s "[what]"
SunGoodEnding_629f1c49		She leans down and kisses you.	game/script.rpy	1698	"[what]"
SunGoodEnding_bb3e2570		You two spend the rest of the day together in the window.	game/script.rpy	1699	"[what]"
SunGoodEnding_910f29b4		In the evening, a patron comes into the shop and buys both of you, together.	game/script.rpy	1700	"[what]"
SunGoodEnding_94c90c80		You expect her to be nervous. But when you glance over at her, she's smiling, that big grin that looks impossibly wide.	game/script.rpy	1701	"[what]"
SunGoodEnding_6af2bee4		But this time, it looks genuine.	game/script.rpy	1702	"[what]"
SunBadEnding_0224ce40	s	But no. 	game/script.rpy	1709	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_d2873567	s	Last night, I realized something.	game/script.rpy	1711	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_8efe53ac	s	If I keep trying so hard to make other people like me, I'll only ever like myself as much as everbody else does.	game/script.rpy	1712	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_416be000	s	I don't think I'll be ready for a relationship until I learn to love myself no matter what people think of me.	game/script.rpy	1713	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_6f340993	s	I'm sorry, Chrys. I hope you don't hate me for this.	game/script.rpy	1714	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_2e0607e2	s	Oh... okay.	game/script.rpy	1719	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_c6c039a9	s	I'm sor--	game/script.rpy	1720	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_430e0c0d	s	Actually, no. That's okay.	game/script.rpy	1722	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_51609092	s	You're allowed to hate me. I hope...	game/script.rpy	1723	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_9eb5d2e2	s	I hope it makes you happy.	game/script.rpy	1724	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_c012cb1b	s	Thank you. I knew you'd understand. 	game/script.rpy	1728	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_2b1f61da		She gives you a little kiss on the petal.	game/script.rpy	1729	"[what]"
SunBadEnding_00d34b34	s	Maybe someday.	game/script.rpy	1731	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_5db88077	s	But right now... I hope you still have a good Valentine's Day.	game/script.rpy	1732	s "[what]"
SunBadEnding_ec2fc71b		Later that day, Sunny gets bought, alone.	game/script.rpy	1733	"[what]"
SunBadEnding_f9377ccf		She seems excited. She sings a little riff of "Wicked" and it shatters the shop door.	game/script.rpy	1734	"[what]"
SunBadEnding_6f52c95c		You're not sure if you'll see her again.	game/script.rpy	1735	"[what]"
mushRoute_d539819f		Sunflower eventually returns, a bit more calm and collected, and you pass the time shooting the wind with her. By the time you stop, a good amount of time has passed.	game/script.rpy	1745	"[what]"
mushRoute_0306b3a0	s	Oh, you're visiting HIM?	game/script.rpy	1750	s "[what]"
mushRoute_b2af6153	s	Well, just be careful! He should be right up by the big crack in the wall.	game/script.rpy	1752	s "[what]"
mushRoute_1fc65f63	s	Have fun!	game/script.rpy	1754	s "[what]"
mushRoute_5dc67ea2		Making your way through the crack in the wall that clearly has fungus growing out of it (how does the shop owner not notice that), you find yourself surrounded by fungi of all kinds.	game/script.rpy	1760	"[what]"
mushRoute_99d5f692		Of course, there’s one fun guy in particular you’re looking for. And you spot them…	game/script.rpy	1761	"[what]"
mushRoute_ce617998		…	game/script.rpy	1763	"[what]"
mushRoute_b9aa6528		Doing a handstand?	game/script.rpy	1764	"[what]"
mushRoute_8b9c110b		Yeah, no bones about it, that’s what they’re doing. Looks like they’re meditating.	game/script.rpy	1765	"[what]"
mushRoute_4d9cd3a4	m	WAAAHHHH!	game/script.rpy	1771	m "[what]"
mushRoute_f806165e		Understandably startled, they collapse to the ground. Trying to play it off like they didn’t have the spores scared out of them, they dust themselves off as they regard you with a warm smile.	game/script.rpy	1773	"[what]"
mushRoute_222899f4	m	Heh, tryna’ gimme a scare, huh? Kudos for trying, but it’s gonna take more than that to scare the cap off of my head!	game/script.rpy	1775	m "[what]"
mushRoute_88529567	m	Well we’ll see about that, sapling!	game/script.rpy	1779	m "[what]"
mushRoute_a5756eb4	m	Oh, hey. Didn’t hear ya come in.	game/script.rpy	1785	m "[what]"
mushRoute_f3eb3bac		They carefully lower themselves from their handstand and turn to face you.	game/script.rpy	1787	"[what]"
mushRoute_21b23482	m	I must be losing my touch, if I can’t even sense a lone flower comin’ up behind me.	game/script.rpy	1788	m "[what]"
mushRoute_b9b7857a	m	Heh, when ya live dangerously like I do, you always gotta be on alert for danger, sapling. That’s rule numero uno of this crazy flowerbed we call life!	game/script.rpy	1793	m "[what]"
mushHelp_da96185f	m	Anyway, how can I help ya? If ya wanna practice fungffiti, ask some other plant. I got a pretty busy schedule ahead of me...	game/script.rpy	1800	m "[what]"
mushHelp_29f1e957	m	I’m sorry, sapling. I know, my home ain’t exactly easy to get to…	game/script.rpy	1807	m "[what]"
mushHelp_84eca943	m	Why’d you come out here anyways?	game/script.rpy	1809	m "[what]"
mushHelp_56f39a03	m	W-wait, really?	game/script.rpy	1816	m "[what]"
mushHelp_d8e28842	m	Uh, I mean-	game/script.rpy	1817	m "[what]"
mushHelp_3572a8dc	m	FUNG YEAH YOU DO!	game/script.rpy	1819	m "[what]"
mushHelp_628e08ad		"FUNG YEAH" indeed.	game/script.rpy	1820	"[what]"
mushHelp_8f652280	m	Heh, well if that’s the case I could make some time for you. Yeah…	game/script.rpy	1821	m "[what]"
mushHelp_ad3f88cc	m	Oh! Uh, yeah I guess I did say that didn’t I?	game/script.rpy	1827	m "[what]"
mushHelp_01e4adb3	m	Well, y’know… I could be less busy for you, sapling…	game/script.rpy	1829	m "[what]"
mushHelp_e1d129c8		Suddenly, as if they’re trying to move past this moment of vulnerability…	game/script.rpy	1830	"[what]"
mushHelp_5eb724fe	m	FUNGEDABOUTIT!	game/script.rpy	1833	m "[what]"
mushHelp_b127a1dd	m	What’re we waiting around here for? Let’s get goin’!	game/script.rpy	1834	m "[what]"
mushHelp_047958a3		And just like that the two of you are off! The two of you spend the day drawing fungffiti, practicing sick flips, and popping ruder squats! It’s the raddest day you’ve ever had. Almost perfect.	game/script.rpy	1836	"[what]"
mushHelp_f26dfcd4		Almost perfect because the whole time something seems off about Mushroom. Like they aren’t putting their full heart into your radivities. Rad activities.	game/script.rpy	1837	"[what]"
mushHelp_10ca204e	m	Heh, that was a pretty rude squat you pulled, but why don’t ya peep this!	game/script.rpy	1839	m "[what]"
mushHelp_8288e323		They pop a squat. It’s… lacking.	game/script.rpy	1840	"[what]"
mushHelp_99d0e0ac	m	Ya gotta harsh my mellow like that?	game/script.rpy	1845	m "[what]"
mushHelp_18fbe66e	m	But since you mentioned it, something is bothering me…	game/script.rpy	1847	m "[what]"
mushHelp_58975272	m	Something bothering me? Me?	game/script.rpy	1850	m "[what]"
mushHelp_de177fea	m	Actually… yeah. There is.	game/script.rpy	1852	m "[what]"
mushHelp_ae2fc659	m	It’s stupid, I should be enjoying myself but I can’t help but think about how this can’t last. Us hanging out like this.	game/script.rpy	1854	m "[what]"
mushHelp_2b859860		They sigh, releasing a small puff of spores.	game/script.rpy	1858	"[what]"
mushHelp_6ba28fcd	m	Sapling… you just don’t get it.	game/script.rpy	1860	m "[what]"
mushHelp_24d2dc14	m	Looks like you landed the proboscis in the nectar, sapling…	game/script.rpy	1863	m "[what]"
mushHelp_448e6fd1	m	Someday, probably soon, you’ll get bought and then it’ll just be me again.	game/script.rpy	1866	m "[what]"
mushHelp_e728c394	m	But that’s just the life of a lone fungus like me, amirite?	game/script.rpy	1869	m "[what]"
mushHelp_0a85130c	m	I…	game/script.rpy	1874	m "[what]"
mushHelp_b651b270	m	Even if that’s true, who else do I have? No other fungus around here can match me, either in raw radness or even sentience!	game/script.rpy	1876	m "[what]"
mushHelp_d3416a20	m	With who? The plants in the shop? I ain’t exactly welcome by every plant.	game/script.rpy	1881	m "[what]"
mushHelp_786e3153	m	And the fungi around here don’t exactly make for great company. A bit lacking in both raw radness and sentience, you dig?	game/script.rpy	1882	m "[what]"
mushHelp_1da78027	m	Face it, you should just forget about me, sapling...	game/script.rpy	1883	m "[what]"
mushGoodEnding_112b667a	m	Huh?	game/script.rpy	1894	m "[what]"
mushGoodEnding_22d46cd1	m	Sapling…	game/script.rpy	1899	m "[what]"
mushGoodEnding_ad64a1a1	m	Fung yeah!	game/script.rpy	1902	m "[what]"
mushGoodEnding_aa1f5153	m	Sapling, I dare ya to stick with this bad boy to the end! In sick-nasty-ness and health!	game/script.rpy	1907	m "[what]"
mushGoodEnding_324df3a0		And just like that the two of you begin planning. Preparing for the sickest stunt ever.	game/script.rpy	1912	"[what]"
mushGoodEnding_2b643b97		When the day comes that you get bought, Mushroom will be right there with you. The plan is for them to sneak into the bouquet with you. Don’t worry, they’ve been practicing making themselves compact.	game/script.rpy	1913	"[what]"
mushGoodEnding_7e478854		Until that day comes, the two of you will spend your time drawing fungffiti, doing sicker flips, and aiming for the rudest squats to end all squats.	game/script.rpy	1914	"[what]"
mushBadEnding_35563e22		You try to find the words, but you just can’t. They’re right of course, and nothing you can think to say could change that.	game/script.rpy	1920	"[what]"
mushBadEnding_0812ef03		Before you head back home that day, Mushroom gives you their sunglasses. They don’t say anything, but you know it’s because they want you to remember them.	game/script.rpy	1921	"[what]"
mushBadEnding_cb46af1f		You get purchased in a lovely bouquet the next day, sooner than you would have thought. Though your time was brief, you’ll always have that one day. The raddest day you’ll ever have.	game/script.rpy	1922	"[what]"
RvCConflict_c3370e49		You decide to head over to Rose and Cactus. It seems Rose is focusing intently on Cactus’ words.	game/script.rpy	1930	"[what]"
RvCConflict_fa1b5484		Cactus notices you approaching.	game/script.rpy	1931	"[what]"
RvCConflict_46fa0db1	c	Well, hey there, new bud! Hope you’re doing well.	game/script.rpy	1933	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_38e6a153	c	I’m tryin’ to teach Rose some Southern slang and sayins’ since she wanted to learn, but…	game/script.rpy	1938	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_0c026dca	r	How Dee y’ee all, I sure do wreck on that this is some fine fancy day for some tooting and shooting...	game/script.rpy	1941	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_d28a9165	c	… No one speaks like that, Rose.	game/script.rpy	1944	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_d71ce233	r	Aww, shucks. 	game/script.rpy	1947	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_0adabc72	r	Oh?	game/script.rpy	1948	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_33dca2de	r	How do you do, Chrys. Tis a fine day that the Lord has made, ain’t it?	game/script.rpy	1950	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_211bf78e	r	Aww, aren’t you a sweetheart, sweetychums.	game/script.rpy	1957	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_2b28876a	r	I do declare, I’ve never been as righter as rain than where I stand.	game/script.rpy	1958	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_2bee6573	c	She’s fine, she’s just… Practicing.	game/script.rpy	1961	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_2fd39ca7	c	She’s been getting better though! Better than this morning.	game/script.rpy	1963	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_db07ee8c	c	Anyways, you’re just in time. I was about to teach Rose a new saying!	game/script.rpy	1965	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_5982219a	c	Here it is: God willin’ and the creek don’t rise.	game/script.rpy	1966	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_52b9cbe2	c	My ma would say this whenever we were in a tight stitch.	game/script.rpy	1968	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_42e70361	c	Kinda like saying “here’s hoping?”	game/script.rpy	1970	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_3c659a53	r	Oh, I see! It’s like that other saying you taught me the other day!	game/script.rpy	1973	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_8513e1c1	r	What was it…	game/script.rpy	1974	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_e0641793	r	Oh! Drenched like a water rat!	game/script.rpy	1975	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_da17f748	r	Uh… Not quite….	game/script.rpy	1978	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_59d862c9	r	Oh!	game/script.rpy	1981	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_1abac884	r	Um...Risk it for the biscuit?	game/script.rpy	1982	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_5987b8e6	c	Nah...	game/script.rpy	1985	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_4b6ca37a	r	Sweatin’ like a sinner at church on a Sunday?	game/script.rpy	1988	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_10a6eb95	c	Bless your heart.	game/script.rpy	1991	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_79a8ee6c	r	Oh, thank you?	game/script.rpy	1994	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_515aaaef	c	No it’s-- it’s fine. 	game/script.rpy	1997	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_7217f9bb	c	I think you mean “Doing it on a shotgun and a prayer,” right?	game/script.rpy	1998	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_17ab651e	r	Hmm…	game/script.rpy	2001	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_e9cb548b	r	No, I’m pretty sure it was the biscuit one.	game/script.rpy	2002	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_51290c00	c	Christ almighty, Rose.	game/script.rpy	2005	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_9c1a4fb5	r	Wait, I know how we can solve this.	game/script.rpy	2008	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_6e6d1842	r	Chrys, you seem like you know Southern sayings. Which is it? Risk it for the Biscuit or Shotgun and a Prayer?	game/script.rpy	2009	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_f64e8e7e	r	See! I’m ri- hold it right there!	game/script.rpy	2016	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_2652a868	r	Chrys!	game/script.rpy	2018	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_76a35d8d	c	No, wait. Chrys is right, you are trying your best. Southern slang is a beast of its own.	game/script.rpy	2021	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_69b368d9	c	And I really do appreciate you going out of your way to try and learn it! It warms my little Texan heart.	game/script.rpy	2023	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_ccb6e14a	r	Oh? Um…haha, I wasn’t expecting such a warm reception, especially with how rough my learning is.	game/script.rpy	2026	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_f63aa6e0	r	I hope I didn’t make you feel uncomfortable.	game/script.rpy	2027	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_d968246f	c	Nah, Rose. The only thing ‘bout you that could hurt anyone’s your thorns.	game/script.rpy	2030	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_5c985948	r	I’m really happy to hear that!	game/script.rpy	2033	r "[what]"
RvCConflict_fc700703		Suddenly, you hear shouting and aggressive quoting of Shakespeare in the distance. 	game/script.rpy	2034	"[what]"
RvCConflict_afc220ed	c	Ah…	game/script.rpy	2036	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_e763b1b4	c	if Y’all don’t mind, It sounds like there’s some trouble brewing over there.	game/script.rpy	2037	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_e24dbc49	c	I’ll go ahead and deal with it. Y’all can keep talking.	game/script.rpy	2038	c "[what]"
RvCConflict_5d41ce50	r	Oh, see you soon!	game/script.rpy	2040	r "[what]"

cactusDate_dd3cefff		Cactus shows you around, giving you a pretty detailed tour on daily life here. There's quite a bit of hustle and bustle in the flower shop, though that may be because tomorrow's Valentine's Day.	game/script.rpy	2091	"[what]"
cactusDate_368b6e90		Time passes. Near the end of his tour, Cactus turns to face you.	game/script.rpy	2092	"[what]"

succulentsCactus_237ccfc5	c	Though I did leave home early. I'm probably just as old as Sunflower, even if it doesn't seem it.	game/script.rpy	2166	c "[what]"
succulentsCactus_16bb419b	c	So don't go 'round calling me "mister," or else the newer buds will get the wrong idea.	game/script.rpy	2167	c "[what]"
succulentsCactus_f38b060c		Cactus snorts. Somehow, against all odds and the laws of nature itself, he can do that.	game/script.rpy	2171	"[what]"

cacHomesick_a39d7805	c	Thank you fer that.	game/script.rpy	2562	c "[what]"
cacHomesick_c60a7bdc		You and Cactus spend the last moments of the day sitting together and watching the moss grow.	game/script.rpy	2565	"[what]"
cacHomesick_0bee939a		Time passes.	game/script.rpy	2566	"[what]"
cacHomesick_d72616e8	c	It's gettin' pretty darn late, isn't it?	game/script.rpy	2569	c "[what]"
cacHomesick_ef59bc3c	c	We've got a big day tomorrow. Let's go ahead and head back for the night.	game/script.rpy	2571	c "[what]"

cacHeadHome_f22431ae		You and Cactus scoot your way back to your place. Before you scoot inside, Cactus turns to you to speak.	game/script.rpy	2577	"[what]"
cacHeadHome_3c621d06	c	Thanks for lettin' me show you 'round the place, Chrys. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I have!	game/script.rpy	2579	c "[what]"

cacEndings_f755b942		With morning comes love in the air!	game/script.rpy	2588	"[what]"
cacEndings_d3d8db5a		While the shop prepares for the horde of shoppers buying flowers for their beloved, you decide to go and talk to your potential beloved. That is, that special someone who hopefully feels the same in return.	game/script.rpy	2589	"[what]"
cacEndings_84542df3		You make your way up to where the succulents stay.	game/script.rpy	2590	"[what]"
CacGoodEnding_4aa62a25		There you spot Cactus, looking his Sunday best. You make your way over to him.	game/script.rpy	2597	"[what]"
CacGoodEnding_e6da86a2	c	Oh, Chrys! Didn't see ya there. Are you ready for today?	game/script.rpy	2599	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_686dd054	c	I've realized... That I'll stay here for a bit longer.	game/script.rpy	2601	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_845dfebf	c	Even though I still miss the Texas sun from time to time, I'm willing to give this city another shot.	game/script.rpy	2603	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_69895e8f	c	Plus, I've got you, Rose, and Sunflower to count on! Y'all have been lifting me up this whole time, so it's high time I stopped mopin' and do the same for y'all!	game/script.rpy	2605	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_feaf9fef	c	Maybe now I can finally teach Rose some actual Southern sayin's instead of the ones she found...	game/script.rpy	2607	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_913bee09	c	...But that's a thought for later. Fer now, I'll focus on today!	game/script.rpy	2609	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_3592bf4b	c	It's gonna be a busy one alright. Hopefully you and both get picked up soon! 	game/script.rpy	2610	c "[what]"

CacGoodEnding_d19f855d_2	c	...	game/script.rpy	2627	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_3f2fde5e	c	ME?	game/script.rpy	2628	c "[what]"

CacGoodEnding_d1d72556	c	... and thank you again for listenin' to my woes and fer puttin' your faith in a cactus like me.	game/script.rpy	2633	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_1b3ce5a3	c	Let's go out again soon!	game/script.rpy	2635	c "[what]"
CacGoodEnding_60aa91ce		And so, Valentine's Day came to an end.	game/script.rpy	2637	"[what]"
CacGoodEnding_fdf17dcd		By the end of the day neither you nor Cactus were bought, but that was okay. 	game/script.rpy	2638	"[what]"
CacGoodEnding_61f0f37f		Y'all had your good friends... a familiar home...	game/script.rpy	2639	"[what]"
CacGoodEnding_e20112a2		...and a little space in the big city carved out for each other.	game/script.rpy	2640	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_94cee11e		But instead of seeing Cactus at his usual spot, all you see is a note with your name on it, among others.	game/script.rpy	2646	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_fa411494	c	{i}Dear Chrys,{/i}	game/script.rpy	2647	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_be92cc50	c	{i}By the time you read this I'll be halfway cross this grand ol' country of ours.{/i}	game/script.rpy	2648	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_af3b964d	c	{i}After our talk I spent a lot of time thinkin' and realized... I feel like I just don't belong here compared to back home in Texas. Bein' here just made me bitter at others, even if they were tryin' to help.{/i}	game/script.rpy	2649	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_4548dfdb	c	{i}So I've decided to move back for the time being. Maybe one day we'll see each other again.{/i}	game/script.rpy	2650	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_1468fd7e	c	{i}Thank you for everything, and I wish you luck today.{/i}	game/script.rpy	2651	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_7f60a058	c	{i}Warm Regards,{/i}	game/script.rpy	2652	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_b7d57329	c	{i}Cactus{/i}	game/script.rpy	2653	c "[what]"
CacBadEnding_77835ffd		Valentine's Day passes by in a blur.	game/script.rpy	2655	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_ccd21777		You're one of the lucky sprouts to be bought, along with Rose and Sunflower.	game/script.rpy	2656	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_482a16ba		The days fly by at your new home, until one day...	game/script.rpy	2657	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_713ced37		On a cloudy morning you wake to see the daily mail next to your pot. Something familiar lays on top.	game/script.rpy	2658	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_d8a0e213		In your leaves you hold a postcard from Texas. The photo has a variety of cacti smiling back at you.	game/script.rpy	2659	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_855b4ceb		And although you no longer have feelings for your first love, something tugs at your heart.	game/script.rpy	2660	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_0da148fa		For a second, the clouds part, letting the sun peek through. You face the bright rays streaking in through the window...	game/script.rpy	2661	"[what]"
CacBadEnding_acf33505		...and just for a moment, you can perfectly picture the warm Texas sun shining down on your face.	game/script.rpy	2662	"[what]"
roseDate_f6f74dbd		As Cactus begins to walk away you see Rose close her eyes and take a deep breath. When they open up she's startled to see you still standing there.	game/script.rpy	2669	"[what]"
roseDate_248322b4	r	Oh, Chrys I wasn't expecting to still see you here! Uh, Cactus sure is nice for teaching me slang huh?	game/script.rpy	2672	r "[what]"
roseDate_9b3f7a66		Rose laughs nervously, her eyes pleading with you to play along.	game/script.rpy	2675	"[what]"
roseDate_6833daac		What remains of her smile quickly evaporates. She lets out a heavy sigh and her demeanor deflates.	game/script.rpy	2681	"[what]"
roseDate_233b57a4	r	That's good. Do you think I was being rude at all? I'd hate to impose on you or Cactus.	game/script.rpy	2683	r "[what]"
roseDate_3c43681b	r	Oh ...	game/script.rpy	2689	r "[what]"
roseDate_79debfe9		Rose seems taken aback by your answer. She looks at the ground with a sullen expression.	game/script.rpy	2690	"[what]"
roseDate_cf73df24		She looks up to meet your gaze and lets out a nervous laugh.	game/script.rpy	2696	"[what]"
roseDate_e2938e29	r	I guess I'll have to find a way to make it up to him, huh?	game/script.rpy	2697	r "[what]"
roseDate_c37844a2	r	Oh, thank goodness! Sometimes I, uh, really worry about accidentally being mean.	game/script.rpy	2706	r "[what]"
roseDate_39c49160		Rose looks away bashfully. There's a moment of silence between the two of you.	game/script.rpy	2712	"[what]"
roseDate_da919b5f	r	 Sorry about that. I just... I just get nervous about stuff like that.	game/script.rpy	2715	r "[what]"
roseDate_342feba7	r	Haha, thanks Chrys.	game/script.rpy	2721	r "[what]"
roseDate_4ac0cd4c	r	I was just trying to go with the flow. Sometimes that goes well, other times... less so.	game/script.rpy	2724	r "[what]"
roseDate_d0ee7e37	r	In the moment it feels right, but afterwards...	game/script.rpy	2725	r "[what]"
roseDate_0dc69adf	r	Rose frowns and shakes herself. The frown slowly turns into a smile.	game/script.rpy	2727	r "[what]"
roseDate_04d6a123	r	Oh, I'm sorry you had to see that. It's nothing you need to worry about honey.	game/script.rpy	2731	r "[what]"
roseDate_4220bdfd		Glancing outside, a sudden look of panic overtakes Rose. Turning to you, she gives a sheepish look.	game/script.rpy	2736	"[what]"
roseDate_27cd7fdd	r	I'm really sorry to have to do this to you, Chrys, but it looks like the time escaped me.	game/script.rpy	2737	r "[what]"
roseDate_dde8dd06	r	I'll be right back, I just have to talk to someone. I'll be right back, promise!	game/script.rpy	2738	r "[what]"
roseDate_78ec665f		You watch as Rose makes a mad dash deeper into the store, leaving you all by yourself.	game/script.rpy	2743	"[what]"
roseDate_dc8a4c76		A few minutes pass before you're approached by another plant.	game/script.rpy	2745	"[what]"
roseDate_6e633674	sp	Hey, you! That was Rose a few minutes ago, wasn't it?	game/script.rpy	2746	sp "[what]"
roseDate_bfce4d50	sp	Sprout: No! She broke her promise to me.	game/script.rpy	2749	sp "[what]"
roseDate_b3c1f6eb	sp	Show me where she went! She broke a promise!	game/script.rpy	2756	sp "[what]"
roseDate_91272dc8		Sprout tremors a little bit and tears begin to well in his eyes.	game/script.rpy	2760	"[what]"
roseDate_71fdd6f5	sp	She said she would keep my parents around. But she lied!	game/script.rpy	2761	sp "[what]"
roseDate_e1a14b83	sp	 I-I woke up on Valentine's last year and I couldn't find them at all!	game/script.rpy	2762	sp "[what]"
roseDate_bb6dbc39	sp	I'll never forgive her. Now, I don't have my mommy and daddy with me!	game/script.rpy	2765	sp "[what]"
roseDate_7bd7a66a	sp	But she made that promise to me! Clearly she didn't care about that.	game/script.rpy	2767	sp "[what]"
roseDate_26b19ab9		Sprout's sad expression changes to one of anger.	game/script.rpy	2768	"[what]"
roseDate_d5d436db	sp	I don't care what you have to say. I'm here to talk to her!	game/script.rpy	2774	sp "[what]"
roseDate_c0da0c52	sp	Tell me where she is!	game/script.rpy	2775	sp "[what]"
roseDate_4e5e4212	sp	You're not trying to lie to me just because I'm young, right?	game/script.rpy	2783	sp "[what]"
roseDate_0b9ee574		Before you can reply to Sprout you see Rose return from within the store.	game/script.rpy	2791	"[what]"
roseDate_ad04627a	r	Hey Chrys, sorry that took so long. I wa-	game/script.rpy	2794	r "[what]"
roseDate_06b549a5	sp	 Rose! You have some explaining to do!	game/script.rpy	2795	sp "[what]"
roseDate_43dbb33a		Rose's eyes widen as she hears Sprout yell. She tenses up at the sound of it.	game/script.rpy	2798	"[what]"
roseDate_926b943e	r	Oh! Sprout I, uh, didn't see you there. What's, um, wrong little buddy?	game/script.rpy	2801	r "[what]"
roseDate_e5286e52	sp	Oh you know what you did! You can't hide from me forever you coward.	game/script.rpy	2802	sp "[what]"
roseDate_7d21d555	r	What? What did I do wrong? I try really hard to be nice to people! Please, I don't want you to be upset with me.	game/script.rpy	2805	r "[what]"
roseDate_f7e98920	sp	No it's not Chrys. She made a promise and then broke it. She needs to explain herself!	game/script.rpy	2809	sp "[what]"
roseDate_b12024eb		Rose is shaking and tears are welling in her eyes. She looks mortified.	game/script.rpy	2811	"[what]"
roseDate_9085d42b	r	Oh no, Sprout. I'm so sorry! I know I gave you my word, and yet...	game/script.rpy	2813	r "[what]"
roseDate_a09262fb	r	You have no idea...no idea how hard I tried. I just wasn't good enough. I...I wasn't enough. I know you might not believe me, but I didn't lie.	game/script.rpy	2817	r "[what]"
roseDate_f693baed	r	Huh? Chrys what are you talking abou-	game/script.rpy	2823	r "[what]"
roseDate_822cbe38		A flash of realization shoots across Rose's face before it's overtaken by a quiet numbness.	game/script.rpy	2825	"[what]"
roseDate_d6b48320		Rose begins to tremble and cry. The pressure is too much to bear.	game/script.rpy	2828	"[what]"
roseDate_7675060e	r	I never meant for it to happen. I did my best, but it wasn't enough in the end. Sprout, you have to believe me!	game/script.rpy	2829	r "[what]"
roseDate_c7cf4280	r	I never wanted to let you down, but... I guess that's what I always do. I'm sorry.	game/script.rpy	2830	r "[what]"
roseDate_8fb86e5b	sp	No, I don't believe it. There's no way you're telling the truth. I hate you Rose!	game/script.rpy	2831	sp "[what]"
roseDate_12e4b5bd		Sprout turns and runs away with tears in his eyes.	game/script.rpy	2832	"[what]"
roseDate_60fb73d7	r	No, Sprout, please come back! I... I need to make it up to you.	game/script.rpy	2835	r "[what]"
roseDate_39954234		Rose is visibly shaking, her tears dripping to the floor.	game/script.rpy	2837	"[what]"
roseDate_6c7ad063	r	I really screwed this one up. God, everyone must really hate me now, huh?	game/script.rpy	2839	r "[what]"
roseDate_1c2e01f3		Rose lets out yet another nervous laugh.	game/script.rpy	2842	"[what]"
roseDate_9ee0f267		Rose doesn't seem to register your question. Her face is blank and her hands are shaking.	game/script.rpy	2847	"[what]"
roseDate_2bcc8e57		Rose looks up and quickly shakes her body. The blank expression is replaced by a soft smile.	game/script.rpy	2852	"[what]"
roseDate_22f98838	r	Oh, Chrys. It's nothing, don't worry! What's up?	game/script.rpy	2855	r "[what]"
roseDate_ca3f9c38	r	Oh Chrys, I appreciate the concern, but you don't need to worry about me. I don't want to weigh you down. This is my problem, not yours.	game/script.rpy	2861	r "[what]"
roseDate_512edbdb	r	Yes, I'll be alright! Now I'm supposed to show you around, right?	game/script.rpy	2867	r "[what]"
roseDate_b0f60ed7	r	Well then, they set you up with the right person! I know this place like the back of my hand.	game/script.rpy	2871	r "[what]"
roseDate_6ecd6934	r	I've got some errands to run, so this is perfect for both of us. Where do you want to go first?	game/script.rpy	2876	r "[what]"
roseCashier_13766f68	r	Oh, the cashier huh? I guess we can go there.	game/script.rpy	2888	r "[what]"
roseCashier_a4afe12f	r	No, no, it's nothing. I did offer to take you there. I'm just surprised, it's not exactly a popular spot.	game/script.rpy	2894	r "[what]"
roseCashier_ad5eb2d6	r	No, nothing like that, Chrys. If you want to go, we can. Come on.	game/script.rpy	2897	r "[what]"
roseCashier_3f094b61	r	OK!	game/script.rpy	2903	r "[what]"
roseCashier_c566c10c	r	Maybe we can hit the perennials section on the way back, just so you get the whole experience.	game/script.rpy	2904	r "[what]"
roseCashier_e9cacd49		You follow Rose as she leads you through the store. You pass by the perennials section, which is full of daisies and other assorted plants.	game/script.rpy	2905	"[what]"
roseCashier_5ffacd63		Along the way you pass Mushroom, Cactus, and Sunflower, who all wave.	game/script.rpy	2906	"[what]"
roseCashier_379abbd9		As Rose leads you through the store you wave back to your new friends. Rose gives a small wave to each of them but powers on past them.	game/script.rpy	2909	"[what]"
roseCashier_25362359		As you slow down to talk to them Rose turns around to talk to you.	game/script.rpy	2914	"[what]"
roseCashier_6f580af6	r	Hey Chrys, I thought we were, uh, going to the cashier.	game/script.rpy	2917	r "[what]"
roseCashier_d9b186b6		Eventually you reach the massive structure that is the counter. There's a loosely constructed pile of gardening supplies that leads up to the counter. Rose looks intimidated.	game/script.rpy	2922	"[what]"
roseCashier_da9785e4	r	So Chrys, you, uh, ready to climb up there?	game/script.rpy	2925	r "[what]"
roseCashier_a28efae8	r	Oh Chrys, you're so nice to me for no reason. To be honest I'm scared of it too. It's why so few plants come here.	game/script.rpy	2930	r "[what]"
roseCashier_40b27aa9	r	But with you here I think I'll be just fine.	game/script.rpy	2931	r "[what]"
roseCashier_0d2881af		Rose gives you a timid nod and begins the trek up to the cashier.	game/script.rpy	2935	"[what]"
roseCashier_0f750bae	r	Oh? I know, righ-	game/script.rpy	2941	r "[what]"
roseCashier_1fd6e88d		Rose looks around nervously, before letting out a sigh.	game/script.rpy	2943	"[what]"
roseCashier_9a6eda7c	r	You're a brave one, aren't you?	game/script.rpy	2944	r "[what]"
roseCashier_7ec1edbe		Rose tries her best to hide it, but she looks really nervous.	game/script.rpy	2945	"[what]"
roseCashier_913e8e82	r	Can I be honest with you?	game/script.rpy	2949	r "[what]"
roseCashier_eadcccde	r	And you won't be upset with me?	game/script.rpy	2953	r "[what]"
roseCashier_efa574cb	r	OK, um. The truth is that, I, uh, I don't like going up to the cashier. Climbing this stuff scares me.	game/script.rpy	2958	r "[what]"
roseCashier_1d030fa4	r	Really? But you don't seem scared at all.	game/script.rpy	2963	r "[what]"
roseCashier_0d2881af_1		Rose gives you a timid nod and begins the trek up to the cashier.	game/script.rpy	2967	"[what]"
roseCashier_6cff6b1c	r	Oh, I'm sorry. I guess you're right. I'll try to be better.	game/script.rpy	2971	r "[what]"
roseCashier_0d2881af_2		Rose gives you a timid nod and begins the trek up to the cashier.	game/script.rpy	2977	"[what]"
roseCashier_ac70561f		As you and Rose climb upwards you walk over gardening pots, bags of fertilizer, and even some gardening tools. But eventually you reach the cashier counter.	game/script.rpy	2982	"[what]"
roseCashier_982994af	r	Wow Chrys, we were able to do it!	game/script.rpy	2985	r "[what]"
roseCashier_f3515b9f		Rose blushes and hides behind her leaves.	game/script.rpy	2991	"[what]"
roseCashier_111a052f	r	Aw, Chrys you're too much. I'm not worth half the compliments you give me.	game/script.rpy	2993	r "[what]"
roseCashier_d68fa39c	r	Gosh, you really now how to make me feel better Chrys.	game/script.rpy	2997	r "[what]"
roseCashier_0f746709	r	 Oh, really? I'm sorry if I was slowing you down. I tried my hardest but I guess that was still too little.	game/script.rpy	3001	r "[what]"
roseCashier_018d4707	r	Yeah, I guess you're right.	game/script.rpy	3006	r "[what]"
roseCashier_25ccadf7	r	Really? I thought you did great, like way better than I did. 	game/script.rpy	3010	r "[what]"
roseCashier_1cb55319		You're welcome Chrys.	game/script.rpy	3014	"[what]"
roseCashier_f21f0406	r	Anyways, I guess I should show you around now. Considering that's my job and all.	game/script.rpy	3017	r "[what]"
roseCashier_68f2d43b		Rose walks you further along the counter and you're met with the full beauty of the shop for the first time.	game/script.rpy	3022	"[what]"
roseCashier_2015877a		The light from outside falls in at the perfect angle, casting each flower in a beautiful bath of sunshine. There are other flowers up here, but you barely notice them while you're caught up in the splendor of the store.	game/script.rpy	3023	"[what]"
roseCashier_2e716539		You stand together on the counter, taking the sight in. Rose takes a deep breath and relaxes her body. She turns and looks at you.	game/script.rpy	3024	"[what]"
roseCashier_30bbf542	r	This is my favorite place in the whole store Chrys. Did I tell you that?	game/script.rpy	3026	r "[what]"
roseCashier_2a18a104	r	I know I shouldn't love this place because of what goes on here... I just can't help it.	game/script.rpy	3029	r "[what]"
roseCashier_8d1fcc4c	r	Normally I don't like to be around other people, even if we aren't talking, but when I'm up here I don't care. The peace I feel here trumps everything else.	game/script.rpy	3031	r "[what]"
roseCashier_ba799279	r	I'm really happy to be here right now. Today has been rough, especially with Sprout being upset with me.	game/script.rpy	3035	r "[what]"
roseCashier_63384bbd	r	 It wasn't easy to deal with either. I hate messing things up for people, and I really hate it when they're mad at me. It just makes me feel horrible.	game/script.rpy	3040	r "[what]"
roseCashier_36db4f5a	r	Oh, uh... Well it is. This is my favorite place to be by myself. I'm most calm when I come here. 	game/script.rpy	3049	r "[what]"
roseCashier_c03ae301	r	Honestly, I was worried having you with me would change that.	game/script.rpy	3050	r "[what]"
roseCashier_a1894e63	r	Oh no Chyrs, it's not that! I just have trouble being around other people. It makes me really nervous. I was worried that if I came here with someone else it would take away from the experience.	game/script.rpy	3054	r "[what]"
roseCashier_ba1cce34	r	Being here is kind of theraeputic, and I didn't want that to change. But now that I'm here with you Chrys, I think I was worried about nothing.	game/script.rpy	3056	r "[what]"
roseCashier_370c1d68	r	No problem. You spending the day with me means a lot too. Thank you for putting up with everything.	game/script.rpy	3061	r "[what]"
roseCashier_9800a9fa	r	No, Chrys. I like you a lot, you're really kind. I just have trouble being around other people. I just get nervous easily and this is the one place I can escape to. I was just worrying about nothing, please don't hate me for it.	game/script.rpy	3068	r "[what]"
roseCashier_03eddc6e	r	OK, that's good to hear. I feel like people don't like me a lot of the time, so I worry it's true.	game/script.rpy	3072	r "[what]"
roseCashier_1830b60b	r	Thanks Chrys. It seems like you always know just what to say.	game/script.rpy	3080	r "[what]"
roseCashier_12248d7e	r	I try Chrys but it's not that simple. Listen I appreciate it, but can we move on. I want this to stay my happy place.	game/script.rpy	3085	r "[what]"
roseCashier2_501849c3		You and Rose sit in silence for some time, ignoring the other plants around you and soaking in the beauty. Rose seems to sink into a deep, trance-like calm and closes her eyes after a while.	game/script.rpy	3093	"[what]"
roseCashier2_9b7716ac		The solemn moment goes on for a while before Rose opens her eyes. When she sees you sitting next to her she seems startled.	game/script.rpy	3095	"[what]"
roseCashier2_e1f6bd2c	r	Um, yeah totally. I just got, uh, lost in the moment is all. Sorry I was quiet for so long.	game/script.rpy	3101	r "[what]"
roseCashier2_4180ddc4	r	OK, good. What do you think of the store so far?	game/script.rpy	3107	r "[what]"
roseCashierNice_5e85001a		A smile lights up on Rose's face.	game/script.rpy	3117	"[what]"
roseCashierNice_f480fe38	r	That's good to hear. Yeah everybody here is really kind. I just don't talk to them enough to really know them.	game/script.rpy	3118	r "[what]"
roseCashierNice_1255d239		Rose's smile turns to a slight frown and she droops a bit.	game/script.rpy	3124	"[what]"
roseCashierNice_b88e9d38	r	I don't know. I feel like I'm bad at talking and I get embarrassed when I do. It just makes me uncomfortable, y'know.	game/script.rpy	3125	r "[what]"
roseCashierNice_23ffce60		Rose freezes for a moment and all expression bleeds from her face.	game/script.rpy	3130	"[what]"
roseCashierNice_06047b30	r	I wasn't before, but I guess I am now. Sorry, I tried going with the flow again and it blew up.	game/script.rpy	3133	r "[what]"
roseCashierNice_094ac293		Rose's deadpan expression is replaced with a more neutral look.	game/script.rpy	3138	"[what]"
roseCashierNice_220311d6	r	OK, yeah. Sorry Chrys.	game/script.rpy	3139	r "[what]"

roseCashierAlright_69f01b54		Rose's face lights up with a quizzical look.	game/script.rpy	3150	"[what]"
roseCashierAlright_5835c266	r	That's a good question Chrys. Hmmm.... I guess I would say this place right here. Being able to come here makes it all worth it.	game/script.rpy	3152	r "[what]"
roseCashierAlright_4f5b651a		Rose seems caught off guard by your question. A nervous smirk replaces her questioning look.	game/script.rpy	3157	"[what]"
roseCashierAlright_97fe6d89	r	Oh, um, I guess I'd have to say all the people. I don't really do well with others.	game/script.rpy	3158	r "[what]"
roseCashierAlright_df39b0fb		Rose's smirk quickly falters into a frown. She looks down at the ground for a moment as her shoulders fall.	game/script.rpy	3163	"[what]"
roseCashierAlright_323e8043	r	Maybe it seems that way Chrys, but that's not how I feel after talking to someone.	game/script.rpy	3164	r "[what]"
roseCashierAlright_066c63e7	r	Don't worry about it, it's nothing new.	game/script.rpy	3169	r "[what]"
roseCashierDislike_68431e69		Rose is taken aback by your comment. Her face goes from shocked to sad in just a few seconds.	game/script.rpy	3173	"[what]"
roseCashierDislike_820990a8	r	Oh Chrys, I'm really sorry to hear that. I know being moved can be a hard adjustment.	game/script.rpy	3176	r "[what]"
roseCashierDislike_6f49a5eb		Rose gives you a look of pity. She seems to genuinely feel bad about it.	game/script.rpy	3180	"[what]"
roseCashierDislike_ecd3f2ad	r	But since I've met you just this morning I've grown to like you a lot. You'll get used to it in no time!	game/script.rpy	3183	r "[what]"
roseCashierDislike_c923cde4	r	I know so! Hey, you might even become more popular than me.	game/script.rpy	3188	r "[what]"
roseCashierDislike_3044b9bd		Rose turns away as she blushes and shakes her head.	game/script.rpy	3193	"[what]"
roseCashierDislike_1c1b5d06		Sorry, that was awkward. Let's just... let's just leave it at that.	game/script.rpy	3194	"[what]"
roseCashier3_869edffd		An awkward silence settles in the air. Rose looks tenser than when you first arrived at the cashier.	game/script.rpy	3200	"[what]"
roseCashier3_f508c11e		Rose looks up from a trance a little caught off guard.	game/script.rpy	3205	"[what]"
roseCashier3_2c926897	r	No, not really. I'm ... I'm sorry, I don't really talk to many people.	game/script.rpy	3207	r "[what]"
roseCashier3_2b798383		Rose takes a deep breath. She looks tired.	game/script.rpy	3212	"[what]"
roseCashier3_1bbcc3e5		Rose is caught off guard by the question at first. She looks at you surprised.	game/script.rpy	3216	"[what]"
roseCashier3_403b01eb		How long have I? Oh, um, I've been here for a year and a half. Why?	game/script.rpy	3218	"[what]"
roseCashier3_c4debaf7		Oh I see.... sorry I didn't pick up on that.	game/script.rpy	3222	"[what]"
roseCashier3_2b7b2301	r	I'm sorry. I guess I'm pretty bad at small talk. Hey... what do you say we, uh, call it a day?	game/script.rpy	3227	r "[what]"
roseCashier3_0ae8d2fc	r	Yeah. I just had a really long day. C'mone, let's go.	game/script.rpy	3230	r "[what]"
roseCashier3_cb4c3fc5		Rose begins to lead you back down to the ground. You take one last look at the splendor that is the store before you head down after Rose.	game/script.rpy	3234	"[what]"
roseCashier3_9c3b9bf0		You follow Rose down the haphazard path and along the floor to the perennials section. Eventually she leads you to your new home.	game/script.rpy	3236	"[what]"
roseCashier3_4f1693a7	r	OK Chrys, this is your new home!	game/script.rpy	3239	r "[what]"
roseCashier3_fb54d1b6		Rose blushes a little, but still looks tired.	game/script.rpy	3244	"[what]"
roseCashier3_481a3b58	r	You're welcome Chrys. Now have a good night.	game/script.rpy	3246	r "[what]"
rosePerennial_b161a632	r	OK, that sounds good to me. I can't wait to show you where you'll be living.	game/script.rpy	3252	r "[what]"

rosePerennial_73d8e240		Rose leads you along the floor through the store. You pass by lots of other plants along the way, and you even see Sunflower, Cactus, and Mushroom.	game/script.rpy	3256	"[what]"
rosePerennial_201bcbb0		You give them a polite wave and Rose follows your lead. They all wave back at you with smiles on their faces.	game/script.rpy	3259	"[what]"
rosePerennial_22dc665d	r	Oh, uh. I don't know if we'll have time to get to everything then Chrys. I don't want you to miss out on the tour.	game/script.rpy	3263	r "[what]"
rosePerennial_cd6cd09f		Rose looks back at you pleased before continuing to lead you towards the perennials section.	game/script.rpy	3267	"[what]"
rosePerennial_bf6f8efc		Eventually you reach your destination, a table with enough space for every perennial in the store, including you and Rose. Off in the distance you can see the cashier.	game/script.rpy	3270	"[what]"
rosePerennial_77eae17d		Rose turns around to speak to you with a wide grin on her face.	game/script.rpy	3272	"[what]"
rosePerennial_558364ed	r	Oh Chrys, I'm so excited to show you your new home. How do you feel?	game/script.rpy	3273	r "[what]"
rosePerennial_83563880		Rose's excitement falters a bit before being replaced by a look of determination.	game/script.rpy	3277	"[what]"
rosePerennial_668f3aff		I understand that Chrys. When I first got here I was really nervous too. Hey, I'm still a little nervous now. But you have nothing to worry about.	game/script.rpy	3278	"[what]"
rosePerennial_b1e8c6d7		Rose looks taken aback for a second.	game/script.rpy	3282	"[what]"
rosePerennial_0650c803	r	Oh Chrys, trust me, that won't be a problem. You're wonderful to be around, and all the perennials are very nice.	game/script.rpy	3284	r "[what]"
rosePerennial_887fcac9	r	I do! And hey, if they don't like you for some bizarre reason, you'll still have me.	game/script.rpy	3289	r "[what]"
rosePerennial_565be9eb		Rose's face lights up again.	game/script.rpy	3297	"[what]"
rosePerennial_e0ff31fd	r	Great! Come on, let's get up there and show you around.	game/script.rpy	3299	r "[what]"
rosePerennial_b0a4041d		Rose turns back around and shows you the way up to the perennials section.	game/script.rpy	3301	"[what]"
rosePerennial_ae042d64		Once you reach the top you're able to see more of the store. It's a beautiful mix of every color imaginable and there are plants everywhere. Rose watches with you, a look of pride on her face.	game/script.rpy	3303	"[what]"
rosePerennial_01dd1ef0	r	Isn't it great Chrys?	game/script.rpy	3305	r "[what]"
rosePerennialPretty_2323fe9f		A small smirk takes up Rose's face.	game/script.rpy	3319	"[what]"

rosePerennialAlright_bc5383c2	r	But enough of that. How about I show you around now?	game/script.rpy	3329	r "[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_709e2c16		Rose looks at you surprised.	game/script.rpy	3337	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_6168113a	r	Really? Nicer than all this?	game/script.rpy	3338	r "[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_b2b41daf		Rose looks at you with total disbelief.	game/script.rpy	3341	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_d8f9b3db	r	There is no way, this place is like a paradise. What made it so much better?	game/script.rpy	3343	r "[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_96be22ea		Rose seems awestruck by the idea of even more flowers and colors.	game/script.rpy	3347	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_66504ae6	r	Wow! That.... that sounds amazing Chrys. No wonder you miss it, I would too. I can't imagine anything more colorful than this store.	game/script.rpy	3348	r "[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_582793b4		Rose nods in agreement. She seems lost in her thoughts for a moment before, suddenly, she shakes herself back to reality.	game/script.rpy	3353	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_13b856e9		Oh, sorry Chrys. I was just thinking about all those colors. Anyways, I should probably show you around now, huh?	game/script.rpy	3354	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_692b16f7		Rose's eyes widen when she first hears this. She seems to be excited by the idea.	game/script.rpy	3359	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_71890639	r	Wow Chrys, I would kill to have a space all to myself!	game/script.rpy	3361	r "[what]"

rosePerennialNicer_1ea9ae35	r	I don't think I would mind that too much. Anyways, what do you say I show you around now?	game/script.rpy	3367	r "[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_2808fee7		Rose seems a little distraught when she first hears this.	game/script.rpy	3373	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_478ab9e2	r	Really? That seems crazy. I wish it was like that here. I feel like I've let so many people down. Especially Sprout.	game/script.rpy	3375	r "[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_85c97d93		Rose looks at you, a little relieved but still a little upset.	game/script.rpy	3379	"[what]"
rosePerennialNicer_d554be5b	r	Yeah I know, I just wish it was that easy.	game/script.rpy	3380	r "[what]"

rosePerennialNicer_9d610c6a	r	Anyways, let's get back to the tour, alright?	game/script.rpy	3383	r "[what]"
rosePerennial2_baebe6a0		Rose turns around and begins leading you through the perennials section. The first group you meet are the daisies.	game/script.rpy	3393	"[what]"
rosePerennial2_9b5bfbcf		Rose takes a deep breath and tries to loosen up a bit before speaking.	game/script.rpy	3395	"[what]"
rosePerennial2_52f87d64	r	OK, so these are the, uh, daisies. I think they look really nice and they seem to be polite.	game/script.rpy	3396	r "[what]"

rosePerennial2_559f1de6	r	OK, so these are the....	game/script.rpy	3413	r "[what]"

rosePerennial2_bdaae4e9	r	The.... Oh yeah! These are the foxgloves. They seem kind of mopey at first, but I think they look cool. Whenever I see them they seem very chill.	game/script.rpy	3418	r "[what]"
rosePerennial2_868e9c54		Rose lets out a nervous laugh.	game/script.rpy	3423	"[what]"
rosePerennial2_e50f012b	r	Oh I, uh... No, I actually don't know them that well. If I did I would tell you some more but, y'know.	game/script.rpy	3424	r "[what]"
rosePerennial2_7514ed99		Rose nods before turning to lead you to the next spot. She seems to be moving slower than before, and even looks a little down.	game/script.rpy	3429	"[what]"
rosePerennial2_2612a303		She turns around and looks surprised.	game/script.rpy	3434	"[what]"

rosePerennial2_e4701cb6		Rose swallows hard and looks anxious.	game/script.rpy	3474	"[what]"
rosePerennial2_208c9c7e	r	OK, so, uh, I was wondering, if it's ok with you, if we could... call it a day?	game/script.rpy	3476	r "[what]"
rosePerennial2_9b48e42c		Rose looks relieved as she quickly loosens up.	game/script.rpy	3481	"[what]"
rosePerennial2_159b048d	r	Great. I wanted to show you more, it's just that... Today was really long, especially with the whole Sprout thing. I'm just really tired.	game/script.rpy	3483	r "[what]"

rosePatio_a7cd13f2		Rose begins to lead you through the winding paths of the store. Along the way you pass various sections you've never seen before.	game/script.rpy	3506	"[what]"
rosePatio_05747ee7		You pass by the annuals section, which is filled with all kinds of flowers. You can see a periwinkle, snapdragon, marigold, and a petunia.	game/script.rpy	3507	"[what]"
rosePatio_253cb2b0		Rose notices you looking at them, so she turns around to talk to you.	game/script.rpy	3508	"[what]"
rosePatio_a2de1f05	r	That's the annuals section. They all seem really nice and I think they're each beautiful, but they don't stay around for very long.	game/script.rpy	3510	r "[what]"
rosePatio_446ecfe9		Rose shrugs.	game/script.rpy	3514	"[what]"
rosePatio_6727a8a9	r	They just don't live as long as us perennials. It's a little weird, but that's just how it is.	game/script.rpy	3515	r "[what]"
rosePatio_3740edbb		Rose continues to show you around the store. She hums a small tune as you approach the door to the patio.	game/script.rpy	3516	"[what]"
rosePatio_1b6952fe		The door is huge and imposing. Light filters in through the glass set in its middle. You can see the outside world from here.	game/script.rpy	3517	"[what]"
rosePatio_35127415		Rose notices your apprehension as you both move closer to the door.	game/script.rpy	3518	"[what]"

rosePatio_53d119cf	r	I understand Chrys. I was worried about it at first too, but I did it and I was fine. It wasn't easy, but I think you can do it too.	game/script.rpy	3530	r "[what]"
rosePatio_d1c0ae57		OK, if you're sure you want to do it we can go.	game/script.rpy	3534	"[what]"
rosePatio_25a221b1		As you and Rose near the massive glass door you hear the whir of machinery begin. The door begins to part automatically, and before long there is a way outside.	game/script.rpy	3538	"[what]"
rosePatio_bdbac1ad		Rose looks at you with a puzzled expression for a moment. Then, something clicks in her head and she begins to speak.	game/script.rpy	3543	"[what]"
rosePatio_2d1f14f3	r	Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. These doors open automatically! Isn't it cool?	game/script.rpy	3545	r "[what]"
rosePatio_0abb2ec9		Rose leads the way through the doors. Once you pass the threshold you're hit with a blast of fresh air and light.	game/script.rpy	3549	"[what]"
rosePatio_467c0678		The sound of the city fills your head fully for the first time. The low drone is off-putting at first, but soon fades into the back of your head.	game/script.rpy	3550	"[what]"
rosePatio_9bb4a834		Rose turns around to look at you and gestures widely at the store's patio.	game/script.rpy	3551	"[what]"
rosePatio_675dd4f7	r	So, what do you think Chrys?	game/script.rpy	3552	r "[what]"
rosePatio_cbfbe3d6		Rose gives you a big smile.	game/script.rpy	3556	"[what]"
rosePatio_664698fe	r	I'm glad you like it Chrys. It's nice to come out here every now and then.	game/script.rpy	3558	r "[what]"
rosePatio_30b3f0b0	r	Let me show you around some more.	game/script.rpy	3560	r "[what]"
rosePatio_cc46a390		Rose nods in agreement.	game/script.rpy	3565	"[what]"
rosePatio_69dee846		Yeah, it can be annoying. I like to be out here occasionally, but after a while it gets to be too much.	game/script.rpy	3567	"[what]"
rosePatio_61f09281		Rose looks a little nervous suddenly.	game/script.rpy	3572	"[what]"
rosePatio_829b01b9	r	Well, uh, sometimes when we get put out here we're mixed with other plants. Like perennials will be with annuals. I don't know any of them that well, so I get anxious because they're new people.	game/script.rpy	3574	r "[what]"
rosePatio_26c38e88	r	So with that and all the noise, it can be rough after a while. That's why I only come here sporadically. It's kind of dumb though.	game/script.rpy	3575	r "[what]"
rosePatio_e7bac1dc	r	Thanks Chrys. You're so supportive.	game/script.rpy	3581	r "[what]"
rosePatio_84794bb1	r	Let me show you around some more Chrys.	game/script.rpy	3582	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_17f26d14		Rose leads you towards a table set in front of the store window. Right now it's relatively empty, but it looks like a lot of plants can fit up here.	game/script.rpy	3587	"[what]"
rosePatio2_750ee1ac		Rose gets a little nervous as she approaches the table.	game/script.rpy	3589	"[what]"
rosePatio2_f5fd0660	r	So this is the, uh, the table where we, um, we spend time outside. Sometimes we get put out here at random.	game/script.rpy	3591	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_274a3ee3		Rose shakes herself out a little bit.	game/script.rpy	3595	"[what]"
rosePatio2_26e14c8f	r	 Yeah, I'm fine Chrys. I just have some bad memories with this table.	game/script.rpy	3596	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_4f2dd631		Rose shakes her head.	game/script.rpy	3600	"[what]"
rosePatio2_d9f3cbdd	r	That's alright Chrys, I appreciate the offer though..	game/script.rpy	3602	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_3cb1583d	r	Anyways... So yeah, you might get put out here with plants from all the different sections. I guess it's a good way to meet other people.	game/script.rpy	3606	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_9696c291	r	Sorry Chrys, I'm just bad at first impressions. Other people seem to do it just fine though. Maybe you should talk to them instead.	game/script.rpy	3612	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_ebf04f84		Rose blushes at the comment.	game/script.rpy	3617	"[what]"
rosePatio2_bd6196ec	r	Thanks Chrys. I don't know why you would want to, but ....	game/script.rpy	3618	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_3f335a7e	r	Do you have any other questions for me about the patio?	game/script.rpy	3620	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_cc46a390		Rose nods in agreement.	game/script.rpy	3624	"[what]"
rosePatio2_9ad38ef1	r	Great, then let's move on.	game/script.rpy	3625	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_ebe542c4		Rose leads you back through the glass doors. Once inside she starts leading you towards the perennials section.	game/script.rpy	3629	"[what]"
rosePatio2_d73ee0ed	r	I think I'll show you the perennials section and let you get settled in, if that sounds OK.	game/script.rpy	3630	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_39e37190		Rose nods in response. She seems a little tense.	game/script.rpy	3634	"[what]"
rosePatio2_32a2a729		Eventually Rose leads you to the perennials section. She shows you how to get up and leads through the area.	game/script.rpy	3635	"[what]"
rosePatio2_1e62255b		You pass by several other plants and even see Rose's home. Eventually you arrive at your new place of residence.	game/script.rpy	3636	"[what]"
rosePatio2_0f215ab1	r	 Well Chrys, this is it for today. Sorry we couldn't do more, I just have something I need to go work on.	game/script.rpy	3637	r "[what]"
rosePatio2_83116bfb	r	Definitely. Have a good night.	game/script.rpy	3641	r "[what]"
roseWork_87b0fb81		As she turns around to leave, Rose's gaze seems to be distant. You hear her mutter something under her breath.	game/script.rpy	3647	"[what]"
roseWork_8b76d9e2		Rose jumps at the sound of your voice. She turns around and lets out a nervous laugh.	game/script.rpy	3653	"[what]"
roseWork_0ada5b2c	r	Oh, uh, yeah! I'm feeling great. I just...have something I need to go work on.	game/script.rpy	3656	r "[what]"
roseWork_dc55ee04	r	I'll see you tomorrow, ok?	game/script.rpy	3657	r "[what]"
roseWork_3796df2b		Rose gives you a wave goodbye and leaves. You're now alone in your new home.	game/script.rpy	3659	"[what]"
roseWork_c419a98c		You decide now is as good a time as any to settle in. You go about preparing your new home and before long it's time for bed.	game/script.rpy	3660	"[what]"
roseWork_e86d31d4		You settle in for the night and it's not long before sleep washes over you.	game/script.rpy	3664	"[what]"
roseWork_52db4ff8		You are able to rest for a few hours, but you awake suddenly in the middle of the night.	game/script.rpy	3666	"[what]"
roseWork_ce16e076		You hear rustling and what sounds like someone talking, but it's distant.	game/script.rpy	3669	"[what]"
roseWork_822ebd89		You force yourself to get up and find out what's happening. It's not easy, and the allure of sleep calls out to you, but you're able to power through.	game/script.rpy	3672	"[what]"
roseWork_45ab7e43		You leave your home and listen closely to where the sounds are coming from.	game/script.rpy	3673	"[what]"
roseWork_f171d2f1		You try to locate where the sounds come from your search leads you out of the perennials section.	game/script.rpy	3676	"[what]"
roseWork_ab238b4e		You get down to the store's floor the way Rose showed you. The sounds seem louder, but are still far away.	game/script.rpy	3677	"[what]"
roseWork_78cba467		The sounds lead you to the cashier. They sound even closer now, but they're still far above you. The rustling is much clearer and you can even make out what sounds like a woman's voice.	game/script.rpy	3680	"[what]"
roseWork_59a06694		You reach the passage way up to the cashier and feel apprehension build. It's even more intimidating when you're in the dark by yourself.	game/script.rpy	3683	"[what]"
roseWork_33b8356a		You begin the treacherous climb up to the cashier, taking care not to misstep or fall. You come close a few times, the darkness hindering your skill.	game/script.rpy	3686	"[what]"
roseNight_b56ba394		When you reach the top you're met with a worrying sight. Rose is up here by herself and she seems worn thin.	game/script.rpy	3707	"[what]"
roseNight_5c7bdafd		Rose jerks around to look at you. A look of shock flashes across her face as she realizes who you are. she begins to speak while holding back tears.	game/script.rpy	3713	"[what]"
roseNight_180a3d52	r	Oh, it's you Chrys. Listen, this is uh, nothing. Just go back to bed. You don't need to worry about me.	game/script.rpy	3716	r "[what]"
roseNight_a3c5c907		You can see her wiping tears from her face.	game/script.rpy	3717	"[what]"
roseNight_05e5314c	r	You're really not gonna leave, huh? Fine then.	game/script.rpy	3721	r "[what]"
roseNight_98a1e902	r	I felt horrible after what Sprout said to me earlier. I feel like I need to make it up to him somehow, so that's what I've been trying to do.	game/script.rpy	3723	r "[what]"
roseNight_d6e6ab14	r	But I feel like there's nothing I can do. I already let him down so hard, and there's no way to come back from that.	game/script.rpy	3724	r "[what]"
roseNight_9c14bbf9	r	I've been trying to come up with something all night, but no matter what I do my brain won't work. I don't know what I'm gonna do Chrys.	game/script.rpy	3725	r "[what]"
roseNight_49e0332e		Rose's face contorts with disgust.	game/script.rpy	3732	"[what]"
roseNight_50c2acd9	r	Seriously Chrys? How could you even say that to me? I'm trying to help Sprout and you tell me I'm a baby?	game/script.rpy	3733	r "[what]"
roseNight_89fe0d75		Rose is glaring at you now. Her hands tremble slightly.	game/script.rpy	3736	"[what]"
roseNight_e9070f31	r	You jerk. Don't you think I know that? I wake up everyday terrified of what will happen and what people will think.	game/script.rpy	3737	r "[what]"
roseNight_6f94c939	r	If I could just not worry then I would. I don't like how I am. In fact I hate it. I can't believe you would say that.	game/script.rpy	3738	r "[what]"
roseNight_ceace6f4	r	Oh you... How many times do I have to say it? I can't help it.	game/script.rpy	3741	r "[what]"
roseNight_b0605a83		Rose looks like she's ready to scream.	game/script.rpy	3745	"[what]"
roseNight_f5ac2faf		That's it Chrys. You're clearly not helping, so just leave me and go back to sleep.	game/script.rpy	3746	"[what]"
roseNight_e7400927		She cuts you off before you can finish.	game/script.rpy	3750	"[what]"
roseNight_6b0be572	r	Just leave me alone Chrys. I don't want to hear anymore. I thought you cared but it's clear you don't.	game/script.rpy	3751	r "[what]"
roseNight_ba54b283		Rose turns around and ignores you. You hear her begin to weep as you make your way down to the shop's floor.	game/script.rpy	3757	"[what]"
roseNight_804d690b		By the time you reach the bottom the crying has stopped and the rustling has continued.	game/script.rpy	3759	"[what]"
roseNight_5c9139e0		You walk home alone in the darkness of the store, Rose's words echoing in your ears.	game/script.rpy	3760	"[what]"
roseNight_f5ee2cc7		You eventually reach the perennials section and your home soon after that.	game/script.rpy	3761	"[what]"
roseNight_445a3395		After you settle back in you slowly fall asleep, but you don't sleep well that night.	game/script.rpy	3762	"[what]"
roseNight_6330ab54	r	Well then what did you mean?	game/script.rpy	3767	r "[what]"
roseConfront_56121788		Rose looks at you confusedly.	game/script.rpy	3774	"[what]"
roseConfront_a51ad154	r	Chrys, I... What do you mean?	game/script.rpy	3775	r "[what]"
roseConfront_478a2605		Rose looks hopeful for a moment before she begins to cry again.	game/script.rpy	3781	"[what]"
roseConfront_c608b19d	r	Chrys please, I can't have him hate me. I already feel horrible about it, I just need to make it up to him.	game/script.rpy	3783	r "[what]"
roseConfront_92455c2e		Rose lets down her guard a little.	game/script.rpy	3787	"[what]"
roseConfront_765a2130	r	Then what am I supposed to do Chrys? Because I can't figure it out.	game/script.rpy	3788	r "[what]"
roseConfront_f347d705		Rose stops crying.	game/script.rpy	3793	"[what]"
roseConfront_cd2bcce0	r	What if they don't get better? What if I screw them up more?	game/script.rpy	3794	r "[what]"
roseConfront_1f9e14bd		Rose takes a deep breath and sits in silence for a moment.	game/script.rpy	3798	"[what]"
roseConfront_8bd4e19b	r	I just... I don't know if I really can do it Chrys. I don't think I have the strength.	game/script.rpy	3799	r "[what]"
roseConfront_74260fc8	r	Really Chrys? You would spend your time helping me clean up my mess?	game/script.rpy	3803	r "[what]"
roseConfront_83995cf2		Rose's eyes begin to tear up again, but this time she's smiling.	game/script.rpy	3808	"[what]"
roseConfront_a1ee0823	r	If you're with me then I might be able to. I just feel like I need to know how it's going to end right now.	game/script.rpy	3809	r "[what]"
roseConfront_da4301a0		Rose nods in agreement and wipes her eyes again.	game/script.rpy	3813	"[what]"
roseConfront_49f4800f	r	Well, what do we do then?	game/script.rpy	3815	r "[what]"
roseConfront_14e158ac	r	Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm sorry I woke you up with this. I'm just being dumb.	game/script.rpy	3821	r "[what]"
roseConfront_8d855183	r	Yeah, you're right Chrys. Let's go.	game/script.rpy	3827	r "[what]"
roseConfront_0cb9bc85		You and Rose begin the walk back to the perennials section, back to your home.	game/script.rpy	3828	"[what]"
roseConfront_a91384f1		Along the way you realize just how beautiful the store is at night. The moonlight casts everything in an ethereal mix of shadow and light.	game/script.rpy	3829	"[what]"
roseConfront_6d3ec261		Eventually you make it back to Rose's home. She looks at you with big eyes.	game/script.rpy	3830	"[what]"
roseConfront_3fd03e3b	r	Thanks Chrys. I really appreciate what you did for me.	game/script.rpy	3833	r "[what]"
roseConfront_4816066e		Rose nods and gives you a little wave before leaving you alone in the perennials section.	game/script.rpy	3837	"[what]"
roseConfront_950b9574		You return to your new home just as you left it. And, slowly but surely, sleep takes you once again.	game/script.rpy	3842	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_054f1acd		You decide to leave well enough alone and go back to bed. You tune out the sounds and before long you're back to sleep.	game/script.rpy	3848	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_025a800a		When you wake up it's raining outside. The sky is dreary and grey, and the store seems lifeless.	game/script.rpy	3849	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_844ecc82		There's a pit in your stomach and you feel worried about Rose. You decide it might be a good idea to check in.	game/script.rpy	3850	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_e7eaad8e		You head to her home, but when you get there you don't see her. You decide to look around the store for her.	game/script.rpy	3851	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_511527a5		You head to the cashier first. You're met with the intimidating climb, now cast in the miserable gray of a rainy day.	game/script.rpy	3852	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_86da7af3		You reach the top and are met with a horrible sight.	game/script.rpy	3853	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_f593b07a		Rose is sittting on the counter, but she seems like a husk of her former self. She looks withered beyond help.	game/script.rpy	3854	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_96fcc878		Rose passed in the middle of the night.	game/script.rpy	3855	"[what]"
roseBadEnding_7caaea7e		All around her you see tear stained papers with ideas on how to apologize to Sprout. It seems like her final moments were spent worrying about him.	game/script.rpy	3856	"[what]"
roseGoodEnding_a8201055		When you wake up sunshine is flowing into the store once again. It's early in the morning and everything is cast in a golden glow. You can hear Rose calling out for you.	game/script.rpy	3861	"[what]"
roseGoodEnding_7b0a2572		By the time you're up, Rose has already found you. She looks like she's doing much better than last night.	game/script.rpy	3865	"[what]"
roseGoodEnding_80eda388	r	Chrys, there you are! I've been looking for a while now. Listen, I wanted to thank you again.	game/script.rpy	3868	r "[what]"
roseGoodEnding_ab3acf0e		Rose shakes her head and gives you a stern look.	game/script.rpy	3873	"[what]"
roseGoodEnding_44322adb	r	No Chrys, it was a big deal. I think you really saved me last night. It means a lot that you came to see me. So... thank you.	game/script.rpy	3875	r "[what]"
roseGoodEnding_cf27b3eb	r	But I have some good news. I'm gonna go talk to Sprout and try to mend things. It might not happen right away, but it'll get better eventually.	game/script.rpy	3880	r "[what]"
roseGoodEnding_15ca3634	r	You helped me realize that. I'll tell you how it goes later. But just enjoy yourself for now. Go explore the store, cause we both know I didn't show you enough of it.	game/script.rpy	3881	r "[what]"
roseGoodEnding_d6d2db18	r	Thanks. I'll see you soon.	game/script.rpy	3886	r "[what]"
roseGoodEnding_ee45202e		Rose gives you a big smile and an even bigger hug.	game/script.rpy	3889	"[what]"
